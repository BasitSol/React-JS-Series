# React Counter App (Gardener's Edition ðŸŒ±)

ðŸš€ A simple counter app built while learning React Hooks and reactive UI principles.

## Features
- **State Management**: Uses `useState` to track and update counter value.
- **Reactive UI**: Automatically re-renders components like plants responding to sunlight.
- **Validation**: Prevents counter from going below 0 (no "over-pruning"!).
- **Debugging Lessons**: Avoided direct state mutation (e.g., using `const` over `let`).

## Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-garden-counter.git


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

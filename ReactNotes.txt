This is the notes of the react library

lecture 1 :
1)If you want to use the react without the framework then use vite and Parcel
coz these are the bundler . it combines many JS files into a single file .
2)With React library there we get attachements like react-dom and react-Native
3)How to make a react project?          npm is the mode package installer which allows us to use the library
  npx create-react-app(project Name)    npx means if you want to use that functionality without downloading the package
  this is the heavy bundle size packages so
  Another way to install depencies and package :
  Use Vite or Parcel these are utilities(Where the vite is the bundler)

How to start your project ?
npm run start

Create react app is not the better otion to make react apps rather use with the Vite.
commands to create and react projects using vite.
npm create vite@latest

Lecture 2 :
You can export the function which returns the html tag in the render as a tag like <App/>.
In Vite project you don't need to to create an element and then render the JSX tag.
You have to fucntion or the JSX tag in the uppper case both while importing and rendering in vite.

While working with the Create react app you have to make in capitalize the names.


************************************ DAY 2 **************************************************************
You can make your own version of the custom react element.
React understand the JSX which means the html is being integrated there .
React use the bundler like vite and babel . which actually transpiler the syntax and make the tree.

You can also make the element using the React.createElement(
  'a',
  {href : "ww.com", target : '_blank'},
  'click me to visit Google'
)  <= this method take the object

In JSX how you can inject the variables ?
const username = "this is"
you can inject it using the curly braces {username}.

Interview : {username} <= this is a evaluated expression. where you write the final output of the JS.like here
i wrote the variable name after initailizing it some value . also you can write some evaluations(if, functions)
you have to write it above and just write the final outcome here in the curly braces.


************************* DAY 3 **********************************************************
Hooks : Used for the state Management and the UI Updation

use state hook :
let [counter, setcounter] = useState(15)
here in array first element is the starting point of the variable and second variable helps for the Updation
of the first variable . You can use any other name for these two variables. and useState is default 15 initial value

just use the initial varible counter anywhere and when you make a function and call the setcounter() method
react will automatically change state and UI updation .
